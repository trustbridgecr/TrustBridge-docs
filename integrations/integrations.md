# Integrations

TrustBridge integrates with powerful third-party services and protocols to provide secure, decentralized, and efficient loan management.

This section provides an overview of the key integrations powering the TrustBridge platform.

## 🔗 Stellar

TrustBridge is built on top of the Stellar blockchain for fast, low-cost, and transparent transactions. Stellar enables the creation of custom assets, trustlines, and smart contract-like behavior using Soroban.

## 🔐 Trustless Work

TrustBridge uses Trustless Work to deploy and manage escrow contracts. Trustless Work provides a decentralized API and contract layer that handles milestone logic, fund release, and dispute resolution.

➡️ Refer to [API Overview](api-overview.md)

## ☁️ Firebase

Firebase is used for non-sensitive, real-time data storage. It powers dashboards, user profiles, notifications, and internal logs that do not require on-chain immutability.

➡️ (Optional) You can document this in a future `firebase.md` file if needed.

These integrations ensure that TrustBridge is fast, scalable, secure, and developer-friendly.
