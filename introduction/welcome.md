# 1.1 Welcome

👋 **Introduction**

Welcome to the official documentation for **TrustBridge**, a decentralized lending platform designed to provide fair, secure, and transparent credit access across Latin America. Built on the Stellar blockchain and integrated with the Blend protocol, TrustBridge offers a user-first approach to crypto microloans through programmable liquidity pools and reputation-based access.

## What is TrustBridge?

TrustBridge is a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending protocol with its own logic layer, created to solve key financial barriers in emerging markets:

- ❌ Lack of access to traditional credit
- ❌ Low trust in centralized lending platforms
- ❌ Complexity of DeFi tools for non-technical users

It operates through **smart liquidity pools** where lenders deposit funds and borrowers access loans using collateral. A decentralized reputation system based on the **TrustBridge Token (TRBT)** rewards responsible behavior and unlocks access to more attractive lending terms.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure Lending:** Automated escrows via Blend and a collective backstop fund to cover defaults.
- 📈 **On-Chain Reputation:** Earn trust over time with TRBT tokens that grant access to higher-tier lending pools.
- 💬 **User-Friendly UX:** 100% in Spanish, education-focused, and designed for accessibility—not crypto jargon.
- 🌐 **Fully Transparent:** All lending activity and metrics are publicly verifiable on the Stellar blockchain.

## Who is it for?

- 📥 Borrowers seeking fair, direct access to stablecoin microloans without banks.
- 📤 Lenders interested in earning yield while supporting real-world borrowers in emerging economies.
- 👨‍💻 Developers and contributors looking to build or extend a transparent, impact-driven DeFi infrastructure.
