It combines the security and transparency of blockchain with a simplified user experience and an on-chain reputation system. TrustBridge empowers real people—freelancers, entrepreneurs, and everyday users—to access and provide microloans without intermediaries, using **Blend** as its core infrastructure.

## 🎯 Mission

To unlock inclusive financial access across Latin America by removing traditional barriers and enabling trustless, transparent lending between individuals.

## 🌍 Vision

To become the most trusted protocol for decentralized lending in emerging markets—where users can access wallet-to-wallet loans with clear rules, guaranteed protections, and a path to long-term financial reputation.

## 🧱 Core Principles

- 🔍 **Transparency**: All activity is verifiable on the Stellar blockchain. No black boxes.
- 🔐 **Security**: Funds are protected through smart escrow contracts and a collective backstop reserve.
- 🧭 **Simplicity**: Designed for first-time crypto users. Clear UI, no jargon, 100% in Spanish.
- 🌎 **Accessibility**: Open to any wallet. No KYC, no bureaucracy, no banks.
- ⭐ **Reputation First**: Responsible behavior is rewarded through the TrustBridge Token (TRBT).

## ⚙️ Core Components

- **User Wallets**: All interactions are non-custodial. You keep control of your funds at all times.
- **Blend Smart Pools**: Liquidity pools deployed via Blend v2, with automated interest, collateral, and backstop logic.
- **Backstop Mechanism**: A percentage of deposits and borrower collateral go into a safety reserve to cover defaults.
- **Reputation System (TRBT Token)**: On-chain score that grows as you use the platform responsibly. Higher scores unlock better pools.
- **Risk Engine**: Powered by Blend, each pool is evaluated as Low, Medium, or High risk. Pools may be auto-frozen under certain risk thresholds.
