# 3.1 For Borrowers

Borrowers can request loans from liquidity pools by submitting proposals that define:

- The loan amount and currency (e.g., USDC)
- The reason or use case
- The expected duration (repayment deadline)
- The collateral required (in XLM)

Once a loan is submitted, Blend's system assesses pool risk and liquidity.

Borrowers can:
- âœ… Submit loan requests through a simple UI
- ğŸ’° Deposit the required XLM collateral
- ğŸ“‰ Track loan status, repayment deadlines, and interest owed
- ğŸ§  Build TRBT reputation by repaying on time

> ğŸ“Œ The higher your TRBT score, the better the pools you can access in the future.
