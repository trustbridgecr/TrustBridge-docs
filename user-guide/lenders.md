# 3.2 For Lenders

Lenders supply funds to curated pools to earn interest passively. Each pool has parameters such as:

- Risk level (Low, Medium, High)
- Interest rate (variable via Blend)
- Loan size and duration constraints

Lenders can:
- 🔍 View active pool performance (utilization, APY, backstop level)
- 💸 Deposit funds (automatically split into active lending and backstop reserve)
- 📈 Monitor interest earned and repayment activity
- ⚠️ Receive risk alerts if the pool's health deteriorates

> All activity is managed from your wallet — no custody, no middlemen.
